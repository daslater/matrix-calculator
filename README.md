# matrix-calculator
A program for doing basic mathematical operations with matrices

This program allows the user to perform addition / subtraction / multiplication / division with matrices, transpose a matrix, find the determinant of a matrix, and find the inverse of a matrix. There is a Matrix class with overloaded arithmetic operators that works with both integer and floating point types. The determinant is calculated recursively by breaking the matrix down into smaller submatrices.
